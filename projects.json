        "highlight": "Built using machine learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) and CRISP-DM to forecast conflict hotspots using ACLED data, with a focus on investment risk assessment.",
        "description": "This project is a data-driven system that predicts the probability of conflict occurrences across African regions to guide multinational investment decisions. Using the ACLED dataset, the system classifies regions by conflict risk using spatial-temporal analysis, real fatality data, and historical trends. It provides detailed insights including:\n\n- Conflict risk level\n- Predicted event type\n- Historical trends\n- Fatality analysis (including outliers)\n- Region-wise investment recommendations\n\nThe system is deployed as a Flask-based web app featuring a dynamic Folium map and detailed textual risk summaries. It's ideal for organizations evaluating regional stability for expansion or operations across Africa.",

It uses text analysis techniques (TF-IDF and cosine similarity) to find and recommend the top 10 similar books. The system focuses on cleaning and organizing data, making it easy to scale for use in online bookstores, libraries, or schools. The data comes from Goodreads and is cleaned to ensure accurate suggestions. Following a structured approach (CRISP-DM), the system improves user experience by offering tailored recommendations. If no match is found, it prompts users to try a different input.",
